# What is this Application?

This is my play project (called: "iTunes Media Search") where i am planning to experiment and present my ideas on how we should do Angular development following some of the best practices.

# Technology Stack

-> Angular latest (As of today March-14th, 2014 it is 1.2.14)
-> Bootstrap 3.1.1
-> Grunt
-> Bower

# Things i am planning write code for:

1) Original sample project organized based on "Type" (controller, services etc) w/ Unit Tests
2) Project sample using RequireJS w/ Unit tests
3) Project sample using Yeoman workflow
4) Project sample using Lineman workflow
5) Replace 'ngRout' with 'ui-router' (https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) and compare differences
6) What are the adavantages in using 'restangular' (https://github.com/mgonto/restangular) instead of default '$resource'?
7) Implement Authentication i.e. 'Login' using Facebook \ Twitter \ Linked-in \ Google+ (all or few of them).
8) How do you protect an angular Route?
9) Write an interceptor (Request and Response) and show how to use them?
10)Display spinner when there is an http request in progress
11)Replace table display with 'ngGrid' (http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/)
12)Replace table display with 'ngTable' (https://github.com/esvit/ng-table)
13)Implement i18n using 'angular-translate' (https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate)
14)Show an example of using 'bindonce' (https://github.com/Pasvaz/bindonce)


# Simple things which i want to Blog:

1) Why should \ shouldn't use '$resource' with respect to '$http'?
